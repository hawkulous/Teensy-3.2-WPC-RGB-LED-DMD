# Teensy-3.2-WPC-RGB-LED-DMD
Very basic project to display WPC DMD images on RGB LED matrix with Teensy 3.2 in 12bit colour.
All the relevant connections can be deduced from the header file. 
The panels I used for the project is GRB, just edit the header file to change to RGB or other.
The program uses a slightly modified version of t3spi library the correct files is attached. The original files is from here https://github.com/btmcmahan/Teensy-3.0-SPI-Master---Slave
